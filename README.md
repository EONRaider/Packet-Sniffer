A simple pure-Python network packet sniffer. Packets are disassembled 
as they arrive at a given network interface controller and their information 
is displayed on screen.

This application maintains no dependencies on third-party modules and can be 
run by any Python 3.x interpreter.

## Installation

Simply clone this repository with `git clone` and execute the `packet_sniffer.py` file 
as described in the following **Usage** section.
```
user@host:~/DIR$ git clone https://github.com/EONRaider/Packet-Sniffer.git
```

Alternatively, this project can be build in docker by cloning the repository (as above) and running:
```
user@host:~/DIR$ docker built -t sniffer <location_of_repo>
```

Then the container can be run container with:
```
user@host:~/DIR$ docker run -it --rm sniffer <args>
```

## Usage
```
packet_sniffer.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-d]

A pure-Python network packet sniffer.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Interface from which packets will be captured (set to None to
                        capture from all available interfaces by default).
  -d, --displaydata     Output packet data during capture.
```

## Running the Application
- Execute the following command with administrative privileges to 
initiate the capture of packets on all available interfaces: 

  `user@host:~$ sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py`

- Sample output captured during execution:
